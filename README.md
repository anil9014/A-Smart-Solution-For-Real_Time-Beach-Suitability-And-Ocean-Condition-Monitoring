Coastal tourism is a key driver of economic growth in India, supported by the government's Blue
Economy policy. However, the nature of ocean and weather conditions poses significant risks to tourists
engaging in recreational activities along India's extensive coastline. To address this challenge, this project
proposes the development of a smart web application that provides real-time beach suitability and ocean
condition monitoring. The application will integrate data from the Indian National Centre for Ocean
Information Services (INCOIS), analyzing critical parameters such as wave heights, ocean currents, wind
speeds, and water quality to assess the safety and recreational suitability of beaches. The platform will
feature geospatial visualization tools and user-friendly interfaces, by using ML algorithm to predict the
weather reports, ocean alert systems.
